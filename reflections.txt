    What new skills have you learned?

    * As I have had HTML knowledge these lections are quite easy. However I have learnt new things what I did not know about earlier. Like the "horizontal rule". I always used border to draw this line. So going through these lections is really worth


    What has been easy?

    * It was easy for me.


    What has been difficult?

    How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

    * No, I have not.
